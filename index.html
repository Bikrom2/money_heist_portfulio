            <h2>Big Brain</h2>
            <p>
                The Professor, real name Sergio, mostly grew up in hospitals due to being a sick child. He leads the
                gang, and is the one who carefully plans and organises the heist in the Royal Mint and the Bank of
                Spain.He was the mastermind behind the plans of the two heists.The Professor falls in love with Raquel
                Murillo, a police investigator leading the case against the heist. He sleeps with her and when her
                mother finds out about his involvement with the heist, he attempts to poison her but pulls out at the
                last second, opting to take advantage of her poor memory and deleting the voicemail. The Professor spent
                years of his life meticulously planning the heist, and covered aspects that most people wouldn't think
                of. His tactic was to lead the police to several dead ends to buy more time for the money to be printed
                and the team to escape.

            <h2>Aggressive Girl</h2>
            <p>
                Tokyo is a young thief on the run from the police after a failed robbery in which her boyfriend was
                killed. Her mother tried to hand her over to the police before she was involved in the heist, but later
                died of cardiac arrest, potentially from stress. She was hired by the Professor to help in carrying out
                a heist of the Royal Mint in Madrid. Together with the other seven robbers chosen for the heist, she is
                taken to a secluded villa where they plan the heist for five months. The Professor asks each of the
                robbers to choose a city name to hide their identities during the robbery and she chooses Tokyo. Tokyo
                is a flirty and rebellious character, and she has a relationship with Rio, that stops and starts
                throughout the first heist. She shares a good friendship with Nairobi, the two having gotten drunk
                together many times. She doesn't like being told what to do and shows dislike for Berlin in the first
                series.
